This project aims to create an app that helps users solve Sudoku puzzles quickly and efficiently by utilizing image recognition technology and machine learning models. The app allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles with a single click, automating the process of identifying and placing numbers on the board.

Features in Development:
Number Recognition from Photos: The app will be able to capture images of the Sudoku board via the device's camera or image upload. Using machine learning models based on the MNIST architecture, the system will automatically recognize the numbers in the image and place them on the board.

Automatic Sudoku Solution: After recognizing the numbers, the app will suggest or calculate the solution for the Sudoku puzzle with a single click, saving the user's time.

Technologies Used:
MNIST Models for handwritten digit recognition.
Machine learning frameworks for model training and execution.
Image processing to read and identify numbers from captured photos.
This project is continually evolving, with new features and improvements being implemented. The ultimate goal is to provide users with an intuitive and automated experience, making Sudoku-solving simpler and faster.
