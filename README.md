# **Sudoku Solver App**

This project aims to create an app that helps users solve **Sudoku** puzzles quickly and efficiently by utilizing **image recognition technology** and **machine learning models**. The app allows users to solve Sudoku puzzles with a single click, automating the process of identifying and placing numbers on the board.

## **Features in Development**

### **Number Recognition from Photos**
The app will be able to capture images of the Sudoku board via the device's camera or image upload. Using machine learning models based on the **MNIST architecture**, the system will automatically recognize the numbers in the image and place them on the board.

### **Automatic Sudoku Solution**
Once the numbers are recognized, the app will suggest or calculate the solution for the Sudoku puzzle with a single click, saving the user's time.

## **Technologies Used**

- **MNIST Models** for handwritten digit recognition.
- **Machine learning frameworks** for model training and execution.
- **Image processing** techniques to read and identify numbers from captured photos.

## **Project Evolution**

This project is continuously evolving, with new features and improvements being implemented. The ultimate goal is to provide users with an **intuitive** and **automated** experience, making Sudoku-solving simpler and faster.
